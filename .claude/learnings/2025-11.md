Economic realism in ABM: Current model samples wealth from distributions (log-normal × Pareto) rather than modeling production. This OVERSTATES the effectiveness of education-based interventions and UNDERSTATES wealth concentration. Missing: capital returns (r×wealth), production functions, and economic growth. The model is 'too optimistic' about reducing inequality through opportunity alone. Adding capital returns would strengthen, not weaken, the core argument that equality of opportunity is insufficient.

Policy intervention architecture: Implementing 7-phase system for inequality interventions (genetic compensation, wealth redistribution, environmental support, inheritance tax). Key challenge: interventions must run every generation efficiently. Design question: one-time or ongoing interventions? Balance model complexity with user comprehension. Estimated 15-21 sessions for full implementation.

Test coverage strategy: Created 75 unit tests for TypeScript ABM before new features. Tests provide refactoring safety net. Key pattern: behavior-based tests (what functions do) over implementation details (how they do it) ensures stability during refactoring. Test organization: separate files for model, visualization, and data structures.
